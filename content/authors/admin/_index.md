I am interested in understanding what genomic data can tell us about past evolutionary processes and events.
My work spans computational methods development to empirical analysis of genetic variation in space and over time.
I am an open-source software advocate and a developer of evolutionary simulation tools,
such as [stdpopsim](https://popsim-consortium.github.io/stdpopsim-docs/stable/index.html) and [tskit](https://tskit.dev/).

Currently, I am working with [Don Conrad](https://conradlab.org/) and Jeff Wall on non-human primates genomics and evolution.
In my PhD, I worked with [Andrew Kern and Peter Ralph](https://kr-colab.github.io/) on simulation-based inference in population genetics and methods development.
In my Master's, I worked with [Rodrigo Cogni](https://ecologia.ib.usp.br/ecoevo/index.html) on the genetics of *Drosophila melanogaster*'s adaptation to temperate climate,
both in space and over time.

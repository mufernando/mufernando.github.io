Fruit flies originated in Africa, but have since expanded their range and are now present across the globe.
They can be used as a model to study the genetics of climate adaptation.
In collaboration with [Rodrigo Cogni](https://ecologia.ib.usp.br/ecoevo/index.html), 
we have been working on understanding the genomic consequences of *D. melanogaster* adaptation to temperate climates.

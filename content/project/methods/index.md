With the growth in genomic data availability, there is a need for tools that scale better.
I have been involved with the development of tools that enable scalable and reproducible simulations,
within [stdpopsim](https://popsim-consortium.github.io/stdpopsim-docs/stable/introduction.html) and [tskit](https://tskit.dev/).
More recently, I have been developing a deep learning method for population genetic inference that takes tree sequences, a scalable format for population genomic data, with [Andrew Kern and Nate Pope](https://kr-colab.github.io/)

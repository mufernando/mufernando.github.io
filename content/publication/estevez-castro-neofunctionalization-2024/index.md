abstract: Mosquito borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and Chikungunya,
  cause millions of infections every year. These viruses are mostly transmitted by
  two urban-adapted mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Although
  mechanistic understanding remains largely unknown, Aedes mosquitoes may have unique
  adaptations that lower the impact of viral infection. Recently, we reported the
  identification of an Aedes specific double-stranded RNA binding protein (dsRBP),
  named Loqs2, that is involved in the control of infection by dengue and Zika viruses
  in mosquitoes. Preliminary analyses suggested that the loqs2 gene is a paralog of
  loquacious (loqs) and r2d2, two co-factors of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway,
  a major antiviral mechanism in insects.

abstract: Speciation genomic studies aim to interpret patterns of genome-wide variation
  in light of the processes that give rise to new species. However, interpreting the
  genomic “landscape” of speciation is difficult, because many evolutionary processes
  can impact levels of variation. Facilitated by the first chromosome-level assembly
  for the group, we use whole-genome sequencing and simulations to shed light on the
  processes that have shaped the genomic landscape during a radiation of monkeyflowers.
  After inferring the phylogenetic relationships among the 9 taxa in this radiation,
  we show that highly similar diversity (π) and differentiation (FST) landscapes have
  emerged across the group. Variation in these landscapes was strongly predicted by
  the local density of functional elements and the recombination rate, suggesting
  that the landscapes have been shaped by widespread natural selection. Using the
  varying divergence times between pairs of taxa, we show that the correlations between
  FST and genome features arose almost immediately after a population split and have
  become stronger over time. Simulations of genomic landscape evolution suggest that
  background selection (BGS; i.e., selection against deleterious mutations) alone
  is too subtle to generate the observed patterns, but scenarios that involve positive
  selection and genetic incompatibilities are plausible alternative explanations.
  Finally, tests for introgression among these taxa reveal widespread evidence of
  heterogeneous selection against gene flow during this radiation. Combined with previous
  evidence for adaptation in this system, we conclude that the correlation in FST
  among these taxa informs us about the processes contributing to adaptation and speciation
  during a rapid radiation.

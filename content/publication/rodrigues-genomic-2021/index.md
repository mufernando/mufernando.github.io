abstract: textlessptextgreaterIt is pressing to understand how animal populations
  evolve in response to climate change. We argue that new sequencing technologies
  and the use of historical samples are opening unprecedented opportunities to investigate
  genome-wide responses to changing environments. However, there are important challenges
  in interpreting the emerging findings. First, it is essential to differentiate genetic
  adaptation from phenotypic plasticity. Second, it is extremely difficult to map
  genotype, phenotype, and fitness. Third, neutral demographic processes and natural
  selection affect genetic variation in similar ways. We argue that textlessitalictextgreaterDrosophila
  melanogastertextless/italictextgreater, a classical model organism with decades
  of climate adaptation research, is uniquely suited to overcome most of these challenges.
  In the near future, long-term time series genome-wide datasets of textlessitalictextgreaterD.
  melanogastertextless/italictextgreater natural populations will provide exciting
  opportunities to study adaptation to recent climate change and will lay the groundwork
  for related research in non-model systems.textless/ptextgreater

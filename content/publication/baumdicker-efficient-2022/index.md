abstract: Stochastic simulation is a key tool in population genetics, since the models
  involved are often analytically intractable and simulation is usually the only way
  of obtaining ground-truth data to evaluate inferences. Because of this, a large
  number of specialized simulation programs have been developed, each filling a particular
  niche, but with largely overlapping functionality and a substantial duplication
  of effort. Here, we introduce msprime version 1.0, which efficiently implements
  ancestry and mutation simulations based on the succinct tree sequence data structure
  and the tskit library. We summarize msprime’s many features, and show that its performance
  is excellent, often many times faster and more memory efficient than specialized
  alternatives. These high-performance features have been thoroughly tested and validated,
  and built using a collaborative, open source development model, which reduces duplication
  of effort and promotes software quality via community engagement.

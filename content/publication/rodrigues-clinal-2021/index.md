abstract: Spatial and seasonal variations in the environment are ubiquitous. Environmental
  heterogeneity can affect natural populations and lead to covariation between environment
  and allele frequencies. Drosophila melanogaster is known to harbor polymorphisms
  that change both with latitude and seasons. Identifying the role of selection in
  driving these changes is not trivial, because nonadaptive processes can cause similar
  patterns. Given the environment changes in similar ways across seasons and along
  the latitudinal gradient, one promising approach may be to look for parallelism
  between clinal and seasonal changes. Here, we test whether there is a genome-wide
  correlation between clinal and seasonal changes, and whether the pattern is consistent
  with selection. Allele frequency estimates were obtained from pooled samples from
  seven different locations along the east coast of the United States, and across
  seasons within Pennsylvania. We show that there is a genome-wide correlation between
  clinal and seasonal variations, which cannot be explained by linked selection alone.
  This pattern is stronger in genomic regions with higher functional content, consistent
  with natural selection. We derive a way to biologically interpret these correlations
  and show that around 3.7% of the common, autosomal variants could be under parallel
  seasonal and spatial selection. Our results highlight the contribution of natural
  selection in driving fluctuations in allele frequencies in natural fly populations
  and point to a shared genomic basis to climate adaptation that happens over space
  and time in D. melanogaster.

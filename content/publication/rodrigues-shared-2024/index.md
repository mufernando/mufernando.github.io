abstract: For at least the past 5 decades, population genetics, as a field, has worked
  to describe the precise balance of forces that shape patterns of variation in genomes.
  The problem is challenging because modeling the interactions between evolutionary
  processes is difficult, and different processes can impact genetic variation in
  similar ways. In this paper, we describe how diversity and divergence between closely
  related species change with time, using correlations between landscapes of genetic
  variation as a tool to understand the interplay between evolutionary processes.
  We find strong correlations between landscapes of diversity and divergence in a
  well-sampled set of great ape genomes, and explore how various processes such as
  incomplete lineage sorting, mutation rate variation, GC-biased gene conversion and
  selection contribute to these correlations. Through highly realistic, chromosome-scale,
  forward-in-time simulations, we show that the landscapes of diversity and divergence
  in the great apes are too well correlated to be explained via strictly neutral processes
  alone. Our best fitting simulation includes both deleterious and beneficial mutations
  in functional portions of the genome, in which 9% of fixations within those regions
  is driven by positive selection. This study provides a framework for modeling genetic
  variation in closely related species, an approach which can shed light on the complex
  balance of forces that have shaped genetic variation.
